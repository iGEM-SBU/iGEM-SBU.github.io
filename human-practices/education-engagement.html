				Stony Brook iGEM is not only the best iGEM team to have ever existed, but also the best team to have ever existed. We've got people. We've got teamwork. We've got trips to adventureland. We've got trips to Taco Bell. <i>We've got trips to Taco Bell</i>. Take a few moments out of your day to bask in the glorious grid of colors and pictures that is our team. I can't come up with any more filler text. How's it going?

					During this event, we talked to incoming students about the many research opportunities available at Stony Brook University. We also mentioned the iGEM competition and the project that will be working on this Summer. Through detailed explanations, we introduced the students to synthetic biology and tried to incite interest into the field of research. We clarified to the students that iGEM is an excellent research opportunity for students with a wide range of experience levels. Participating in a Summers worth of research with iGEM will help you build a solid basis for research techniques. These qualities such as teamwork and problem solving that you obtain through the iGEM experience will be useful for almost all future professions. Additionally, iGEM helps students network with Stony Brook professors in the STEM fields, which is exceptionally beneficial for incoming students.

					This was a fundraising event that we hosted at Melville Library in Stony Brook during finals week. We advised students passing by to fuel their brains with the snacks we made. These homemade snacks included chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate-dipped pretzels, and M&M cookies. In addition to raising money for our research, we were successful in communicating our project with our fellow students and faculty. Many students passed by and asked what our cause was for and we introduced them to the iGEM competition and the field of synthetic biology. During this event, we were fortunate to meet Dr. Devinder Mahajan, who was willing to meet with us and help us with our project.

					We visited a local high school in the East Meadow School district. During this visit, two of our team members presented to a research class with students ranging from Sophomores to Seniors at WT Clarke High School. We explained what iGEM is, the importance of synthetic biology and how it works, and what our project entails. In addition to spreading the knowledge of iGEM, we discussed how important it is to engage in research, and explained how one could start obtaining research experience at an early age. As a reminder of how molecular biology is fun and exciting, we gave the students temporary DNA tattoos. The teachers at WT Clarke High School enjoyed our visit and asked us to come back to present to first-year students. We gifted the faculty forum activity from Building with Biology called “Should we genetically engineer mosquitos?” to bring further interest about the ethical considerations of synthetic biology. We also sent them our PowerPoint as a resource for future students. While engaging students, we hoped to spark more interest in the field of synthetic biology by showing them the many opportunities that are available for them.

					We appealed to younger kids by changing up our activity from last year which involved the “See DNA” kit from iGEM. While the kit produced interesting conversations with attendees, we wanted younger children to gravitate towards us, so we decided to do an interactive arts and craft instead. We had the children make necklaces out of centrifuge tubes, colorful strings, colored water, and glitter. The children learned how to pipette various concentrations of the colored liquid, representing our cyanobacteria in lab, into the microcentrifuge tube with a medicine dropper or a micropipette. The glitter represented the nutrients that our cyanobacteria needed. Through our activity, we taught basic laboratory skills and cell culture concepts to children, teens, and adults. We also talked to parents and enthusiastic children about our project, and how we are engineering cyanobacteria to overproduce sucrose which can be used for ethanol in sustainable bio-fuel. Another way we attracted attention at this fair was by bringing along a parrot. Just like our cyanobacteria, the parrot (Gosha) is just as green and very friendly. Our table was filled with eager parents and children ready to learn from us.

					We talked to the incoming Freshman class and their parents about synthetic biology, what it entails, and how students can be involved in research and make a difference in their fields of interest. Specifically, we talked to them about what iGEM is, what past projects have done, and what our project entails this year. Many were interested in our research program and asked about the workings of synthetic biology and undergraduate-led research.

					Two members of our team spoke to a group of students that ranged from high school level to college in the program. Since most of our team have just finished their freshman year, we felt this was a great opportunity to mentor students who are entering the college process. We answered questions about college and then gave them a tour of the lab. We explained what iGEM was like and promoted the team to them.

					During our visit to a science camp, held at the West DNA Learning Lab, three of our members presented to children in middle school and high school. Our presentation outlined the basics of biology, synthetic biology, and iGEM. Through our presentation, students were also able to learn about research opportunities at the high school and collegiate level. As an incentive to have the children participate, we handed out iGEM pens. The faculty at the DNA Learning Lab enjoyed our visit and asked us to present at future camps. We hope to spark further interest in students through our presentation and positive personal experiences in research.

					Noticing the lack of “_______”, our iGEM Team wanted to form a synthetic biology activity that was educational, inexpensive, interactive, and fun for younger audiences. After much brainstorming, we came up with an E. coli buddy activity for younger children to create their own genetically engineered E. coli. To enact this, we reached out to Giantmicrobes and ETC ETC ETC

					To increase awareness of synthetic biology, we held a booth at the LaValle Movie Night, where parents and children from Suffolk County came to our University's football field to watch the animated movie Sing. To engage the children, we gave out pompoms and explained basic principles of biology and what molecular biology means. For older audiences, we handed out flyers explaining our project and spoke with parents and members of the community about what synthetic biology entails. Many were very interested to see what we were doing and teaching! A fun event for the community and for the iGEM team as well.

				<h2>Girls Inc.</h2>

					Although there is a steady increase of women entering STEM field, they are still outnumbered by men. Girls Inc. is an organization that focuses on empowering young girls with research-based activities and other programs. Our visit to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), where the Girls Inc. event was held, was both stimulating for the girls and for our team. We started our visit by observing a panel of executives from companies and corporations, such as National Grid, providing insight and advice on how to succeed. Next, we presented about iGEM, our project, synthetic biology, and even gave a “crash course” on basic biology terminology. The girls were captivated and asked us questions about our research experience and advice on what classes they should take. To further enrapture the girls, five team members created a game to crystalize the concepts of genes and promoters. In order to solve a real world problem, the girls were asked to create theoretical gene circuits with promoters, genes and restriction enzymes. The girls were creative in producing their gene circuits. For example, one girl came up with a sensor that would detect high acidity and would show bioluminescence in the presence of pollution and other girls tried to tackle diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes. Then, they were given two different colored string to represent the DNA that they twisted and tied together to create plasmid DNA. Our activity was a success as we were invited back to present to BNL.
